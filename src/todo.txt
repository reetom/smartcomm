DEMO Script - 

Hi, today I am going to show you an ecommerce storefront called SmartComm, that I built from scratch. It's built on node-react
 stack. It's a single page application, which means it's lightning fast. I started building the storefornt as a POC and got
so involved and interested that I decided to build all the features. Right now, the version 1 of SmartComm is available 
with a rich featureset, which I will show you in a min. And there is a progressive roadmap to take it to the next level.
Even in it's current form, it's capable of hosting an ecommerce business in the most elegant and competitive way.


And that's it. Its amazing how a small side project done in spare time can become a fully fleshed product in no time.
In the next version of the app, my focus will be primarily on error handling and making the site responsive, besides adding 
some more features to it. Thank you for watching.
